# One final logic exericse

I have loaded the data in the file `mydata.dat` into the NumPy array called `xvals` by using the command:

```python
xvals = np.loadtxt("mydata.dat")
```

one final time.  To complete this exercise you need to use what you have learned in previous exercises __to set the variables `nlefive` and `nmefive` equal to the number of elements in `xvals` that are less than or equal to five and the number of elements in `xvvals` that are greater than or equal to five__ respectively.

Be aware that many novice programmers try to be clever about how they are using if statments and to thus write less code.  When they do this they often make mistakes.  When it comes to if statements it is therefore better to write more code and to be sure that it right. Coding interview problems like FizzBuzz are often designed to ensure that applicants are not trying to be too clever off the bat.
